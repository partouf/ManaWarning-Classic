# ManaWarning-Classic

This is an attempt to make the ManaWarning addon compatible again with WoW-Classic.

ManaWarning was initially a TBC/WotlK addon, but the sourcecode from that time is lost.

So starting with the latest version, I'm trying to reintroduce old mechanics and refit the UI, but hopefully with as much features as possible.
